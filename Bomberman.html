            <p class="title3">Working with an In-House Game Engine</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    This project started as a a University assignment, where I had to remake the classic Bomberman game using, a non-UI, in-house game engine.
                    This way my first time working outside of any "Big" game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine, without any documentation or tutorials to follow.
                    So if I didn't know how the engine behaved I had to go through the source code and understand it myself, or if a feature didn't exist (like UI support) I had
                    to implement it myself.

            <p class="title3">HLSL Shader Programming</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Though not very complicated, I had to write a shader for this project. I opted to write a simple vignette shader that would darken the edges of the screen.
                    This tought me the very fundementals of working with the HLSL language.

            <p class="title3">Working with Nvidia PhysX</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Most of the core features of Nvidia PhysX were already wrapped in the engine, but I did have to edit the game engine a little as well as go through a lot of the
                    PhysX documentation in order to get certain things working, such as collision channels and limiting the movement of the player so they could not escape the map.

            <p class="title3">Proper Code Structure</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Though this was not the purpose of this project, I did my best in keeping the code clean and organized. I made sure to seperate all the different systems
                    that I used and wrote them to be as re-usable as possible. For example, I wrote a simple implementation of the Observer pattern in order 
                    to communicate between the different systems, such as the Game Loop Manager, the UI Manager and the players.

            <p class="title3">Creating Debug Tools With ImGui</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <img src="./assets/ImGuiDebug.png" alt="Image" class="image-container image-left">
                <p class="paragraph-left">
                    The engine that I used had built in functionality for ImGui but not any tools. So I had to write my own debug tools in order to help me debug the game.
                    I created some simple tools, like a character controller which allowed me to alter a character's stats, a free-flying camera and a map viewer.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The map viewer was the most helpful, since I opted to create a grid component which was responsible for keeping track of all the game objects in the game.
                    Therefore, I needed to be able to see what the grid looked like, and what every cell contained at any given time.

            <h1 class="title2">Would Add</h1>

            <p class="title3">AI Players</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Perhaps my favourite feature that I would like to work on is adding AI agents. I would probably use a a FSM or GOAP approach to make the AI agents
                    and use the A* algorithm to navigate the map. When making the game, I did not account for this so I would also have to refactor a lot of the player class
                    in order to share the proper functionality between the players and the AI agents.

            <p class="title3">More UI & Game Loop</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Currently, the only UI you can interact with is the main menu. I would like to add a pause menu and a settings menu.
                    I would also like to add a game settings menu after you start the game so you can select things such as the map you would like, the amount of players, 
                    the pickups you would like enabled etc.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    This would also allow me to further improve the UI system I implemented, as the engine didn't have any support for it. I would like to wrap a lot of the
                    features that you have to manually implement inside every UI element, such as the position and size of the elements.
