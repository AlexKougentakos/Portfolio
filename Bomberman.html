            <p class="title3">Working with an In-House Game Engine</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    This project began as a university assignment where I had to recreate the classic Bomberman game using a
                     custom, non-UI, in-house game engine. This was my first experience working outside of major engines
                      like Unity or Unreal, without the luxury of extensive documentation or tutorials.
                    So if I didn't know how the engine behaved I had to go through the source code and understand it myself, or if a feature didn't exist (like UI support) I had
                    to implement it myself.

            <p class="title3">HLSL Shader Programming</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Although not overly complex, I had to write a shader for this project.
                     I chose to create a simple vignette shader that darkened the screen edges. 
                     This experience introduced me to the fundamentals of HLSL shader programming,
                      providing a solid foundation for future graphics programming tasks.

            <p class="title3">Working with Nvidia PhysX</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    While the core features of Nvidia PhysX were integrated into the engine, I still needed to make
                     modifications to the engine and delve into PhysX documentation to get specific functionalities 
                     working. For example, I had to configure collision channels and restrict the player's movement 
                     to prevent them from escaping the game map.

            <p class="title3">Proper Code Structure</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Although clean code wasn't the main focus of this project, I made a point to keep my codebase
                     organized and maintainable. I separated different systems and aimed for reusability.
                      One example is my implementation of the Observer pattern, which enabled communication 
                      between systems like the Game Loop Manager, UI Manager, and player controls.

            <p class="title3">Creating Debug Tools With ImGui</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <img src="./assets/ImGuiDebug.png" alt="Image" class="image-container image-left">
                <p class="paragraph-left">
                    The engine provided built-in functionality for ImGui, but no pre-made tools. To aid in debugging,
                     I developed my own tools, such as a character controller that allowed real-time stat adjustments, 
                     a free-flying camera, and a map viewer
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The map viewer was the most helpful, since I opted to create a grid component which was responsible for keeping track of all the game objects in the game.
                    Therefore, I needed to be able to see what the grid looked like, and what every cell contained at any given time.

            <p class="title2-header">What I would</p>
            <h1 class="title2">Like to Add</h1>

            <p class="title3">AI Players</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    One feature I'm particularly interested in adding is AI-controlled players. I would likely use
                     a Finite State Machine (FSM) or Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) approach to design the AI
                      behavior, and employ the A* algorithm for pathfinding. Since the game wasn't originally designed
                       with AI in mind, I would need to refactor the player class to share necessary functionality 
                       between human players and AI agents.
                </p>

            <p class="title3">More UI & Game Loop</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Currently, the only interactive UI is the main menu. I'd like to expand this by adding a game settings
                     menu before starting a match. These additions would allow players to select options like map choice
                     , number of players, and enabled pickups.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Enhancing the UI system would also give me an opportunity to refine the custom UI implementation I
                     created, encapsulating features like element positioning and sizing, which currently need to be
                    manually configured for each UI component.
