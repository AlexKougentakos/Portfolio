            <p class="title3">Networking In Unreal Engine 5</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <img src="./assets/NetworkingImage.png" alt="Image" class="image-container image-left">
                <p class="paragraph-left">
                    The primary goal of developing this game was to deepen my understanding of multiplayer functionality in 
                    Unreal Engine 5. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into replication, the listen server
                     model, and server-client architecture. One of the most intriguing challenges was determining when to
                      use replication, whether to rely on RPCs or replicated variables, and how to optimize network traffic. 
                      Although I never intended to release this game, I aimed to maintain a server-authoritative architecture,
                       keeping the client as simple as possible.

            <p class="title3">Client Side Prediction</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Another interesting concept I learned about was client side prediction. 
                    This technique enhances the game's responsiveness by allowing the client to predict the outcome of the
                     player's actions, then adjusting if needed when the server responds. This approach is particularly
                      effective for actions that must feel immediate to the player without compromising server authority.
                       A practical example is weapon reloading, where the HUD updates instantly, correcting if necessary
                        when the server confirms the action.

            <p class="title3">Server Side Rewind</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-right">
                    Perhaps the most challenging yet fascinating concept I explored was server-side rewind (SSR),
                     a lag compensation technique that improves both responsiveness and fairness in the game.
                      I implemented SSR in the shooting mechanics. When a player fires a shot, if SSR is enabled,
                       the server rewinds the player's position to the moment of the shot and simulates the event 
                       from its perspective. This allows the server to accurately determine whether the shot was a hit 
                       or a miss before relaying the result back to the client.

            <p class="title3">Animation Blending</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <img src="./assets/AnimGraph.png" alt="Image" class="image-container image-left">
                <p class="paragraph-left">
                    Since I could only use animations that I got from the Unreal Engine Marketplace, 
                    I had to make the most out of them. This led to a deeper understanding of the animation state machine and how to blend animations together.
                    I also learned how to replicate animations effectively, using the already replicated player
                     model, since the animation instance itself isn’t replicated by default.

            <p class="title3">Anti Cheat Detection</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    A fascinating area I’d like to explore further is anti-cheat detection. 
                    My first step would be ensuring all critical game logic is server-authoritative, 
                    as currently, some client-side authority could be exploited through memory address manipulation. 
                    For instance, the fire delay for weapons is currently managed client-side, which could be vulnerable.

            <p class="title3">Networking Improvements</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    I would like to add a number of improvements regarding the networking.
                    One idea is implementing a lobby system that allows players to browse available lobbies,
                     view player counts, ping, game modes, and maps before joining,
                    instead of being randomly assigned to a game

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Another area of interest is developing a friend system, which would involve creating
                    an account system, potentially integrating the Steam API—a tool I haven’t yet explored.

            <p class="title3">More Game Modes</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Since the project's main focus was networking, I didn't dedicate much time to developing the actual gameplay.
                     However, if I had the opportunity to continue, I would implement various game modes like team deathmatch,
                      capture the flag, king of the hill, and push the payload to enhance the gaming experience.
