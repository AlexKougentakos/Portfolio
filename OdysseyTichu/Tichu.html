            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    The Engine/Framework development part of this project was a part of one of my Programming courses at University. I kept working on the engine even after
                    the course, and I learned a lot about how engines work, how to structure them and how to make them as re-usable as possible. I also learned a lot about
                    "wrapping" certain aspects of the engine, in order to make it easier for the end user to use, and leave all the memory managment to the engine.

            <p class="title3">Working with CMake</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    When I originally made this engine, it did not have any CMake support. So I had to go through the process of porting the engine to CMake.
                    This was a significant learning experience, as it allowed me to add support for Emscripten and compile the engine to WebAssembly.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="title3">Web Assembly</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    One of my goals was to compile projects made with my engine to WebAssembly. This was my first foray
                     into cross-platform development, so it proved to be a great learning experience on project structuring 
                     and managing differences between compilers and platforms. 

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In case you did not notice, at the top of this page you will find a card game I made with the engine, compiled to WebAssembly.
                    Though you might be confused if you don't know how the game is played.
                    If you are using a smaller screen, the game was replaced by a video, since it couldn't be displayed properly.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    A practical example of this cross-platform development is my implementation of the Audio System.
                     I encountered challenges getting Jthreads to compile with Emscripten, so I wrote a different
                      sound manager specifically for the web. The engine switches between sound managers based on
                       compilation flags, thanks to the service provider pattern I had already integrated.

            <p class="title3">Programming Patterns</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    As a part of this course, I had to implement a number of programming patterns and make use of them into the engine. 
                    Before this I did not know what programming patterns were, so this was a nice addition to my knowledge.
                    I implemented many patterns, some that are available to the user, such as the Observer pattern and the command pattern, 
                    and some that are used internally, such as the Service Provider pattern for the sound system, the Factory pattern for the game objects 
                    and the Singleton pattern for a few systems of the engine such as the ResourceManager.
                    <br> Most of these patterns were studied from the book 
                    <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com" target="_blank">"Game Programming Patterns"</a> by Robert Nystrom.

            <p class="title2-header">What I</p>

            <p class="title3">AI Players</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    While programming the game, I ensured that the authority of the game logic resided in a separate class, 
                    with the Scene merely communicating information primarily sourced from Player Components. 
                    This setup was designed with the future addition of AI agents in mind
                    <br/>
                    To implement AI, I would likely use a subset of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, 
                    such as limited information set MCTS, given the imperfect information in the game. However,
                     this wasn't fully accounted for initially, so the Player Component would need refactoring to
                      blend functionalities between human players and AI agents.

            <p class="title3">More Polishing</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    The only other thing I would add to the game is more polishing, such as a main menu and a selection screen to choose the amount of points the
                    game should last for. Other than that there is not much more to offer to the player for such a simplistic game. Other polishing features could 
                    include perhaps being able to re-arange your cards in your hand, or the ability to change the card designs.
