                <p class="paragraph-center">
                  The core algorithm for this project was the Delauny Triangulation algorithm. I had to learn the process of reading how an algorithm works,
                  breaking it down and then implementing it in code. I also had to do this with Kruskal's algorithm for the minimum spanning tree.

                <p class="paragraph-center">
                  This project was my first major solo endeavor without external guidance, which provided a
                   significant learning experience. Without the safety net of direct mentorship or predefined 
                   instructions, I had to rely entirely on my problem-solving abilities and programming knowledge.
                    This experience gave me deep insights into how to effectively use object-oriented programming
                     (OOP) principles.

                     I learned to structure my codebase, design classes, and manage the interactions between objects
                      to create a coherent and maintainable system.

          <div class="paragraph-container">
              <p class="paragraph-center">
                I plan on implementing this project in Unreal Engine 5. That way I can actually explore the dungeons made by the algorithm in a 3D environment.
                When doing this, I would also need to account for the corridors, and how they interact with each other. I plan on using a grid system for the 
                rooms when I make this.

          <p class="title3">A third dimension</p>
          <div class="paragraph-container">
              <p class="paragraph-center">
                  After porting the project to UE5, I would like to add a third dimension to the dungeons. Meaning that I would like rooms to be able to spawn
                  above each other. In order to achieve that I would need to research and implement a three dimensional triangulation algorithm.
