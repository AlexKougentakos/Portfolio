            <h1 class="title2">Learned</h1>

            <p class="title3">Engine Architecture and Design Patterns</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Developing the Vulkan engine from scratch deepened my understanding of engine architecture. I implemented an Entity-Component-System 
                    (ECS) design, which promotes flexibility and scalability by allowing game objects to be composed of reusable components. 
                    This approach enhances maintainability and facilitates the addition of new features without significant restructuring.

            <p class="title3">Vulkan API</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Working directly with the Vulkan API provided me with in-depth knowledge of low-level graphics programming. I deepend my understanding
                    of the graphics pipeline. I gained hands-on experience with pipeline creation, memory management, descriptor sets, and 
                    synchronization primitives.

            <p class="title3">CMake Automations</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Managing the build process with CMake was a crucial aspect of the project. I gained experience in writing complex CMake scripts, 
                    including custom configurations that automate the organization of project files. By creating a script that dynamically 
                    generates Visual Studio filters based on folder structures, I reduced IDE clutter and improved navigation efficiency.

                    <br/>

                    Using CMake I also connected a custom shader compiler .bat file that automatically compiles all the shader files during the build time.

            <p class="title2-header">What I would</p>
            <h1 class="title2">Like to Add</h1>

            <p class="title3">PBR Support</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    I already have support for basic textures, so the next step would be to add support for Physical Based Rendering, which includes not only the
                    albedo but also normal, roughness, metalic and ambient occlusion maps.

            <p class="title3">Input System</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Right now the only input I have is inside a camera controller class but it's quite hacky. I'd like to wrap GLFW's input functionality
                    into a robust input system. One that would be accessible through the scene and would use some sort of event dispatcher that you
                    could subscribe to.

            <p class="title3">ImGui Implementation</p>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph-center">
                    Even though I wanted to keep this as a non-UI based engine, I do want to add basic ImGui support so that you can more easily debug
                    issues during run time and display important information. But I don't plan on making an entire scene hierarchy and viewport for the engine.
